    "Wouldn't it be possible, for example, for you to receive the notebooks by e-mail and solve them? In theory it would be possible, but remember how many times we fixed some bugs and kindly asked you to pull again from the repository? Now imagine that you'd receive an email everytime, that would amount to quite a few e-mails right? "

So, is GitHub useless and are we just making you use it because we're secretly sadistic? Nope! The truth is that GitHub (or any other version control software for that matter) was really designed to solve the problem of multiple people working on the same code. While that won't happen during the prep course, it is still important for you to know how Git eases the development process when there are multiple people involved, since in the industry almost no developer works alone.

The whole team is working on the same project. So, by the end of the day, each and every one of you sends an e-mail to the other 4 guys in the team with the code that they've done in the day. Next day in the morning, you have to:\n",

    "\n",
    "Saving a version of your project after making changes is an essential habit. But without a version control software, this becomes tedious and confusing very quickly: \n",
    "- What do you save? Only the changed files or the complete project? In the first case, you'll have a hard time viewing the complete project at any point in time - in the latter case, you'll have huge amounts of unnecessary data lying on your hard drive (one of my ex-colleges at KPMG got to a version 142 of an Excel file!).\n",
    "- And how do you name these versions? If you're a very organized person, you might be able to stick to an actually comprehensible naming scheme. However, as soon as it comes to variants (say, you need to prepare one version with just a summary and one with the whole work), chances are good you'll eventually lose track.  \n",
    "- How do you know what exactly is different in these versions? Very few people actually take the time to carefully document each important change and include this in a README file in the project folder. And even if you do, just maintaining the README will take a lot of work!\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system acknowledges that there is only one project. Therefore, there's only one version on your disk that you're currently working on. Everything else - all the past versions and variants - are neatly packed up inside the version control system. When/if you need them, you can request any version at any time and you'll have a snapshot of the complete project right at hand."

It is the starting point by which when someone arrives at the repo, they know what they should do next and what the repository is all about. It is the documentation of the repo.

    "It's very easy to accidentally commit a file (especially if you use `git add .` to stage all files in the current directory). That's where a .gitignore file comes in handy. It lets Git know that it should ignore certain files and not track them.\n",
    "So, what types of files would you normally not want to commit?\n",
    "- Any file with more than 100MB, so always include the dataset that you're using\n",
    "- Log files\n",
    "- Files with API keys/secrets, credentials, or sensitive information\n",

    "\n",
    "To include files in the .gitignore, just type the name of the file. The same thing for directories, except that directories should end with a slash (/). Some slightly more advanced ways of excluding files make use of the wildcard (*). The wildcard matches 0 or more characters. So, for example, if you want to exclude every .log file you would include *.log in your .gitignore. However, when using this rule you may end up ignoring a specific file that you want to commit, e.g. you may want to commit a specific log named important.log and exclude all the others. If that happens, you can use a ! to specifically negate a file that would be ignored, in our example you would include the following line in your .gitignore: !important.log"

    "But first, let us understand the workflow. The remote repository is the github repository that is on the github servers. The first question you may have is: why do we need a workspace and a local repository? And why is there a staging area inbetween them? Let me try to explain: the local repository is the “container” that tracks the changes to your project files. It holds all the commits — a snapshot of all your files at a point in time—that have been made. The workspace consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of the workspace as a file system where you can view and modify files. The staging area is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the workspace to the files in the local repository. When you make a change in the workspace, the index marks the file as modified before it is committed."

This means you can make all sorts of edits to unrelated files, then go back and split them up into logical commits by adding related changes to the stage and commit them piece-by-piece. We always want to create atomic commits so that it’s easy to track down bugs and revert changes with minimal impact on the rest of the project."

    "- The last 5 lines of the output are what's called a diff chuck. A diff only displays the sections of the file that have changes. In our current example, we only have one chunk since we're only altering a file that has one line. Let us skip the first line of the diff chuck for now. The content of the diff chunk (except the first line) displays the recent changes. Each changed line is prepended with a + or - symbol indicating which version of the diff input the changes come from. Lines that start with a + sign were added, and lines with a - sign were removed. Lines with no + or - are here just to give us some context of the code. In our simplistic case, both files had no newline at the end of the file. Let us now get back to the first line of the diff chuck. This line is called the chunk header. Each diff chunk is prepended by a header inclosed within @@ symbols. The content of the header is a summary of changes made to the file. In our simplified example, we have -1 +1 which means that line one had changes. Since this is a very simplistic example, let us analyse a more realistic header, for example: \"@@ -34,6 +36,8 @@\". In this header example, starting from line number 34, there are 6 lines that were either removed (would have a - sign) or were there for context. Additionally, starting at line 36, 8 lines were either added (would have a + sign) or were there for context. "
